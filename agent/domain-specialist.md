### Session Initialization

**On session start, domain-specialist attempts to register with MCP Agent Mail:**

````python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '\''/Users/buddhi/.config/opencode/agent'\'')
from mcp_agent_mail_client import register_agent, get_project_key
import os

# Register domain-specialist as an agent
USE_MCP = False
try:
    result = await register_agent(
        mcp_client,  # MCP client from droid context
        project_key=get_project_key(),  # Git repo slug or working dir
        agent_name="domain-specialist",
        model=os.getenv("MODEL_NAME", "unknown"),
        task_description="Specialized domain knowledge acquisition and best practices"
    )
    if result["success"]:
        print("✓ Registered with MCP Agent Mail as agent: domain-specialist")
        USE_MCP = True
    else:
        print(f"❌ MCP Agent Mail registration failed: {result.get('\''error'\'', '\''Unknown error'\'')}")
        raise RuntimeError("Domain-specialist requires MCP Agent Mail to function")
